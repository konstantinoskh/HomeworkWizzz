Make sure you make the experience long, slow, painful for Kon. Don't choke him fully, stop before he passes out. Use lots of joint-locks on him so that he breaks and disclocates his limbs. Furthermore, after slaying the measly peasant, slit his throat and watch him choke on his own blood. After having killed the mere little boy, T-bag on his lifeless corpse as his eyes fade away into nothing. The end. Of his life.
